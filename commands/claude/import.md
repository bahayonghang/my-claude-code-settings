# Session Context Import

Please restore the context for our session by reading and analyzing the session summary file.

## Instructions

1.  **Identify File**: Look for the file specified in the arguments. If no argument is provided, default to looking for `session_context.md` in the current directory.
2.  **Read Content**: Use your file reading tool to read the entire content of that file.
3.  **Internalize Context**: detailedly analyze the "Goal", "Accomplishments", "Key Decisions", and "Next Steps" from the summary.
4.  **Acknowledge**:
    *   Confirm you have successfully read the context.
    *   Briefly restate the **Current Goal** and the **Immediate Next Step** to show you are aligned.
    *   Ask me if I'm ready to proceed with the next task.

## Error Handling
If the file does not exist, please inform me and list the `.md` files in the current directory that might be context files.
