### OMO Agents (Multi-Agent System)

Inspired by [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode), these skills enable multi-agent collaboration where specialized agents work together on complex tasks.

**Core Concept**: Instead of a single AI handling everything, specialized agents collaborate—each excelling in their domain—to deliver better results.

- **sisyphus** - Main orchestrator that plans, delegates, and executes complex tasks
- **oracle** - Expert architect for design decisions and code review
- **explore** - Fast code search for locating code and tracing dependencies
- **librarian** - Documentation researcher for external docs and best practices
- **frontend-engineer** - UI/UX expert for creating beautiful interfaces
- **document-writer** - Technical writer for README and API docs
- **multimodal-looker** - Visual analyst for images, PDFs, and charts

**Quick Start**:
```
@sisyphus Add user authentication to this project
```

Sisyphus will automatically coordinate other agents to complete the task.
