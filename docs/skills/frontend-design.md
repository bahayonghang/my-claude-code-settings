# frontend-design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality.

## Philosophy

This skill creates interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Every design should be:

- **Distinctive** - Memorable and unique
- **Production-grade** - Functional and polished
- **Intentional** - Clear aesthetic direction

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic
3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements
4. **Differentiation**: What makes this unforgettable?

## Aesthetic Directions

- Brutally minimal
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Organic/natural
- Luxury/refined
- Playful/toy-like
- Editorial/magazine
- Brutalist/raw
- Art deco/geometric
- Soft/pastel
- Industrial/utilitarian

## Focus Areas

### Typography
- Choose distinctive fonts (avoid Arial, Inter, Roboto)
- Pair display font with refined body font
- Unexpected, characterful choices

### Color & Theme
- Commit to cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents

### Motion
- High-impact animations
- Staggered reveals on page load
- Surprising hover states
- CSS-only when possible

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry and overlap
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Visual Details
- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Custom cursors

## Anti-Patterns

Never use:
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter design

## Output

Working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with clear aesthetic point-of-view
