# Import Session Context

The `/import` command allows you to restore the context of a previous session by reading a summary file generated by `/export`.

## Usage

```bash
/import [filename]
```

*   **`[filename]`** (Optional): The path to the context file. Defaults to `session_context.md` if not specified.

## Description

Starting a new session often means losing the "memory" of what was just accomplished, what architectural decisions were made, and what exactly needs to be done next.

The `/import` command solves this by ingesting a structured **Handoff Summary**. It instructs the AI to:
1.  Read the specified Markdown file.
2.  Internalize the goals, accomplishments, and pending tasks.
3.  Align its internal state with the project's continuity.

## Workflow

1.  **End of Session A**: Run `/export`. A file `session_context.md` is created.
2.  **Start of Session B**: Run `/import`.
3.  **Result**: The AI immediately knows:
    *   "Ah, we are building the login flow."
    *   "We finished the `auth_service.py`."
    *   "The next step is writing unit tests."
