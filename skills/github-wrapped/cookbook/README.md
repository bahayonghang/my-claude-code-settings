# Cookbook

This folder exists to keep `SKILL.md` concise while still providing deep, reusable templates.

Guidelines:

- Treat everything here as **optional**: open only the exact file you need.
- Code snippets are **recipes**: adapt them to your dataset schema and renderer.
- No snippet should require network access at runtime; all analysis must run on saved `raw/*.json`.

Contents:

- `python/`: analysis recipes for building a deterministic dataset from `gh api` raw JSON.
